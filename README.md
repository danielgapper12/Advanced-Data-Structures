# CPTS 223: Advanced Data Structures

This repository contains my coursework and implementations from **CPTS 223 â€“ Advanced Data Structures** at Washington State University.

Throughout the course, I explored a variety of data structures, focusing on their implementation, analysis, and real-world application. Each assignment involved selecting, designing, or optimizing the appropriate data structure for a given problem, emphasizing performance and efficiency.

## Topics Covered

- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (binary, AVL, heaps)
- Hash Tables and Hashing Techniques
- Graph Representations and Traversals
- Recursion and Divide-and-Conquer
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Time and Space Complexity Analysis

## Skills Demonstrated

- Object-oriented design in C++
- Analyzing and comparing data structure efficiency
- Writing modular and reusable code
- Debugging and unit testing custom containers
- Applying algorithmic thinking to practical problems

Each project reinforced a key concept and challenged me to think critically about algorithmic design decisions. This repository serves as a record of my progress and a reference for future software development work.
