This project was focused on LinkedLists and Arrays.
I created a studying guessing game which takes a random Linux command and shows three random descriptions,
one of which is correct.
If you select the correct description for the given command you get the points, otherwise you lose points.
You are able to add and remove commands, and log in to save your game and continue playing later.
